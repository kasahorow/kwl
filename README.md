# kwl
KWL is a semantic representation of natural language. A KWL representation can be transformed into any natural language with a grammar and a dictionary of that language.

For example, 
&lt;kwl nom:dog ; kwl&gt; becomes [kraman (Akan), dog (English), chien (French)]

&lt;kwl pro:you tdy(tu(act:be)) det:a(adj:important_nom:person). ; kwl&gt; becomes [ You are an important person (English) ]

You can transform simple English into KWL representation, and then convert the KWL representation into any of the supported languages. Note that all the text is in lowercase.
